The plugin "react-d3-speedometer" requires at least version "2.1.0-rc.0" to support React 18. The plugin developement has ceased, so the "master" branch might offer even better React 18 support, hopefully without introducing new bugs, given its "LTS status". However, building "master" is non-trivial (npm install won't work) and there is currently now reason (bug) that necessitates it, so I decided to stick with "^2.1.0-rc.0". 

Here are the alternatives:
"react-d3-speedometer": "github:palerdot/react-d3-speedometer#master",
"react-d3-speedometer": "^2.1.0-rc.0",

To build react-d3-speedometer from "master":

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/palerdot/react-d3-speedometer.git
cd react-d3-speedometer
npm install --legacy-peer-deps # these are just for testing
npm run build
npm link
cd ~/bmi-calculator
npm link react-d3-speedometer
